This is my code to read a text file. When I run this code, the output keeps saying "File not found.", which is the message of FileNotFoundException. I'm not sure what is the problem in this code.
Apparently this is part of the java. For the whole java file, it requires the user to input something and will create a text file using the input as a name. After that the user should enter the name of the text file created before again (assume the user enters correctly) and then the program should read the text file. I have done other parts of my program correctly, but the the problem is when i enter the name again, it just can not find the text file, eventhough they are in the same folder.
