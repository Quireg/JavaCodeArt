Realise program of Internet shop(using OOP principles).

The several type of goods in the shop

1. Notebook (model, weight, cost, manufacturer, type, OS, size, wifi)

2. Mobile telephone (model, weight, cost, manufacturer, RAM, OS, diagonal, video)

3. Printers (model, weight, cost, manufacturer, type, color)




All goods save in file(or maybe several files)FOR MORE interesting work you can use MY SQL DB

So you must create console possibility to communicate user with shop. When start program, user can input different command

- help
        to see all commands
- price
        load and view all information in console(like table)
- basket
        see all goods in the user basket
-buy <id>
        load goods from file by id and pass it to the basket
-commit
        generate purchase report to the console and file
-clean
        clean all goods from basket
-exit

In this task you need use OOP principles(strongly require)
